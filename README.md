# SG_LSTM
This is the repository of SG_LSTM methods 
The dataset is 159MB for one fold of five folds, which I may upload later.
After generation of Dataset, SG-LSTM(for test the model).py can help to build the model
SG-LSTM(for roc curve generation).py can use the model to do the test job, (generation of ROC curve)

SG128_317_gene.csv is the embedding merged
