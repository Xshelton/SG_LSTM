Environment: 
hardware: Intel i77700HQ ;GTX1060 6G;32 GB RAM
OS:win 10 64bit
Python version: IDLE (Python 3.7 64-bit)#yep I wrote directly in IDLE :)
Needed python package: 
PyQt5                5.10.1(for UI)
Pandas               0.24.1(for file read)
Sklearn              0.0(for comparison)
tensorflow-estimator 1.13.0(for LSTM)
tensorflow-gpu       1.13.1(for LSTM)
numpy                1.16.2(for npy read and other functions)

# SG_LSTM_Dataset UI 
I designed an UI for dataset construction. 

This is the repository of SG_LSTM methods 
The dataset is 159MB for one fold of five folds, which I may upload later.
After generation of Dataset, SG-LSTM(for test the model).py can help to build the model
SG-LSTM(for roc curve generation).py can use the model to do the test job, (generation of ROC curve)

SG128_317_gene.csv is the embedding merged from Geometric information embedding and Sequence information embedding of gene.
SG128_383_miRNA.csv is the embedding merged from Geometric information embedding and Sequence information embedding of miRNA.
The Dataset can directly generated by this two file like the paper has introduced.

S_gene2vec_320_34567.csv S_mrna2vec_384_34567.csv is the embedding generated from sequence information.
G_gene2vec_328_gene.csv G_mirna2vec_384_mirna.csv is the embedding generated from geometric information.

S_gene2vec_320_34567.csv+G_gene2vec_328_gene.csv can generate SG128_317_gene.
S_mrna2vec_384_34567 +G_mirna2vec_384_mirna.csv can generate SG128_383_miRNA.csv
for running all_unkown_sample_generation.py

"SG_383_gene_default.csv" is needed,this file is the Dataset ,which can be generated by SG128_317_gene.csv  and SG128_383_miRNA.csv.
the Example of X_train5.csv and X_test5.csv is also uploaded in the cloud disk .

For the file that are too large to upload in the github,we also uploaded the file into the cloud disk for your reference.
The S128_383_miRNA.csv can be download

with file X_train5.csv and X_test5.csv, two python file can be run in the folder.
