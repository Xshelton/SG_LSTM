# SG_LSTM
This is the repository of SG_LSTM methods 
The dataset is 159MB for one fold of five folds, which I may upload later.
After generation of Dataset, SG-LSTM(for test the model).py can help to build the model
SG-LSTM(for roc curve generation).py can use the model to do the test job, (generation of ROC curve)

SG128_317_gene.csv is the embedding merged from Geometric information embedding and Sequence information embedding of gene.
SG128_383_miRNA.csv is the embedding merged from Geometric information embedding and Sequence information embedding of miRNA.
The Dataset can directly generated by this two file like the paper has introduced.

S_gene2vec_320_34567.csv S_mrna2vec_384_34567.csv is the embedding generated from sequence information.
G_gene2vec_328_gene.csv G_mirna2vec_384_mirna.csv is the embedding generated from geometric information.

S_gene2vec_320_34567.csv+G_gene2vec_328_gene.csv can generate SG128_317_gene.
S_mrna2vec_384_34567 +G_mirna2vec_384_mirna.csv can generate SG128_383_miRNA.csv
